# dota2 stats Data
======================

## Purpose
These are auxiliary files that turn the individual IDs into the corresponding heroes, game modes, patches, etc.

Most of the files were created manually and do not need to be updated.

The patches were recorded with the help of https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Portal:Patches.

For the heroes, new ones are added regularly, so the little helper.py helps keep the hero_ids.txt up to date.
